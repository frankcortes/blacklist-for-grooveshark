#Blacklist for Grooveshark

##Why?

When I'm playing random playlists (like popular, or random songs), sometimes I would avoid several songs I don't like too much. For this reason I created this bookmarklet. You can ban the songs you don't want to listen and shift to the next song automagically.

##Use

1) Copy this link like a bookmarklet:
``

2) Go www.grooveshark.com, for instance in your own playlist or popular list.

3) Click in the bookmarklet.

4) A new button with "x" icon appears in every song like this

![new button](img/buttons.png)

5) ???

6) Profit!!!


##How it works
The plugin is split into different files, *blacklist-api.js* and *blacklist-ui.js*. The first one implements the required methods and the other creates a interface to use them.

##API
This plugin extends `window.Grooveshark` object) ([here the public API](http://developers.grooveshark.com/docs/js_api/)) with a new methods, so another developers can use the blacklist-api to develop another plugins.

- addSongInBlackListFromSongID
- getSongsInBlackList
- removeSongInBlackListFromSongID


##FAQ
###Why are you using Underscore/Lodash in your code?
I'm taking advantage of some libraries have been loaded for Grooveshark.com,like Lodash or jQuery are. I know they are using require.js and Backbone.js, although I don't want to use its versions - concretely they aren't using all the Backbone components.
###Are you using my account to save the blacklist?
Nope. I'm using your `window.localStorage` object to store the data. Don't worry: This information is just inside in your browser and it will never share with anyone.
###Using a bookmarklet all time is a bit tricky. Could you implement a Chrome/FF extension, please?
Well, I will try this if I have enough time in the near future. Feel free to implement this doing a pull request or creating another repo using the *blacklist-api.js*.
